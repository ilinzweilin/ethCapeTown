## Why?

Decentralised digital independence!

Buying airtime is expensive (and expires!)
access to roaming internet and don't have money 
Some people just need enough data to check for directions or call for a taxi.
Sometimes people have a WiFi network at home, and could use a side income stream.

## How?

By enabling fair and private internet access via micropayments over the Raiden Network, to incentivise and tokenise a mesh network.
